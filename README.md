# Sonic the Fighters - A Work-In-Progress Decompilation

This repository will contain buildable code using GCC-esque tools to compile the executable binaries necessary to run the data of Sonic the Fighters on a Model2b arcade board. It is an accumulation of many years of work to better understand the inner workings of AM2's arcade engine from the early to mid-1990s.

## Compiling the program ROMs (DSP and sound executable decomps coming soon)

   - While the code is almost entirely still in assembly language, the way it is built will mostly remain the same as this repo evolves.
   - It's recommended to install CTOOLS 6.0 from this [archive.org mirror](https://archive.org/details/iq-80960-rxk-5-2). For Linux users, CTOOLS should be WINE compatible, but you can try prebuilds of [i960-elf-gcc-3.4.6](https://archive.org/details/i960-elf-gcc-3.4.6.tar) or [i960-coff-gcc-3.4.6](https://archive.org/details/i960-coff-gcc-3.4.6.tar). You can also attempt to build your own with instructions to get you started with binutils 2.16 I've provided [here](https://github.com/biggestsonicfan/stfdisasm/tree/master/GNU).
   - Ensure the `bin` folder of your GCC tools is in your path or edit the Makefile to point to the correct directories. (TODO: Create automake file which verifies GCC versions and assigns paths)
   - Put `schamp.zip` (`MD5 4826E870E5652811DE149C2EC89E3A20`) and `sfight.zip` (`MD5 E801C222C174E45E091E361DE83503F0`) in the `rom` directory for asset extraction. (Currently used for DSP binaries but will be used for sound, texture, and model extraction sometime in the future)
   - Further dependencies (`make`, `python`, `md5sum`) will vary by platform, but I highly recommend Windows users open the repo's folder with VSCode to recognize the `Makefile` to ensure the environment will be correct.
   - In a terminal window (PowerShell is recommended for Windows users), navigate to the repo and run `make`. The Makefile should produce a binary in the `bin` folder with presplit ROMs for use in emulators in the `split` folder.
   - #### TL;DR: Use CTOOLS, put the ROMs in the rom folder, and run the Makefile.

## Assets

No assets for the game will be provided in this repository, however, you will be able to extract them all using the various scripts and binaries in this repo.
- Using the `data_extract.py` script you can extract various assets:
	- Run with `--all` to extract all currently supported asset extractions (they will be listed below)
	- Run with `--rom` to extract all interleaved ROM data from the `schamp` and `sfight` archives located in the `rom` folder.
	- Run with `--cpres` to extract and process DSP coprocessor executables from `rom_code1.bin` into 80960 compliant `.S` preprocessor files. (This will become deprecated when the coprocessors become decompiled)
		- More to come... (Models, textures, sounds, music samples, music arrangements)

## Fork recovery research

This fork adds an evidence-first recovery workflow inspired by the independently
recovered Model 2A runtime in `celsowm/vf2-decomp`.

Start with:

- `docs/VF2_CROSS_TITLE_ANALYSIS.md` for shared VF2/STF runtime anchors and
  the cross-title strategy.
- `docs/RECOVERY_TRACE_CONTRACT.md` for the JSONL trace and differential
  snapshot contract.
- `tools/recovery/model2_crossmatch.py` to rank STF assembly candidates
  against recovered VF2 regions without assuming matching function addresses.
- `tools/recovery/trace_fields.py` to infer fighter/object fields from
  base-relative memory accesses.
- `tools/recovery/classify_tgp_trace.py` to classify TGP/geometry traffic.
- `tools/recovery/compare_state.py` for fail-closed differential state
  comparisons.

These tools do not make semantic renames automatically. Cross-title matches are
treated as hypotheses until STF-specific tracing or differential evidence proves
them.

## What this project is:

This is a work-in-progress project of disassembled code from Sonic the Fighters which will be converted, function by function, to human-readable C/C++ code. One of the project's main goals is create an analysis of a game and all its components. These components will be broken down to code and assets, the logic and building blocks of the game, in a way that can be rebuilt into its original executable form.

## What this project _is not_:

This project is not open source. Just like its predecessor, [stfdisasm](https://github.com/biggestsonicfan/stfdisasm), it is source-available. This code is [not licensed](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/), and as such, all rights are reserved. GitHub's terms of service [allow users to view and fork the repository within the GitHub site](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository#choosing-the-right-license), and this allows for pull requests. The code may become licensed someday, but for now it will remain source-available for research purposes.
